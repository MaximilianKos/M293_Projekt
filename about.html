				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello there! My name is Maximilian and I am a 16-year-old software engineer currently in my first year of apprenticeship with The I-Engineers. I have always been fascinated by technology and the ways in which it can be used to solve real-world problems.<br />
					<br />
					My interest in programming began when I was just a child, and since then, I have been constantly developing my skills in this field. I have learned several programming languages and have a solid understanding of software development principles.<br />
					<br />
					Working at The I-Engineers has been a great experience for me so far. As an apprentice, I am given the opportunity to work on real projects and collaborate with experienced developers. This has allowed me to apply my knowledge and gain valuable experience in the industry.<br />
					<br />
					In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with different programming languages. I also enjoy playing video games and spending time with friends and family.<br />
					<br />
					Overall, I am passionate about software engineering and am excited to see where this career path takes me in the future.
